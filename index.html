<p>The Boss 429 (also known as the "Boss 9" by enthusiasts) is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle cars to date. [1] In total there were 1358 original Boss 429s made. The origin of the Boss 429 came about as a result of NASCAR. Ford was seeking to develop a Hemi engine that could compete with the famed 426 Hemi from Chrysler in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series (then known as "Grand National Division"). NASCAR's homologation rules required that at least 500 cars be fitted with this motor and sold to the general public. After much consideration, it was decided by Ford that the Mustang would be the car that would house this new engine.</p>

<p id="special">The Ford Motor Company was riding high on the success of the original Mustang the first four to five years after its release; however, they were also developing a “secret engine” to take the Mustang from a simple Pony Car to a muscular Thoroughbred.   After the marriage of this “secret engine” with the 1969 Fastback, it set the world on fire.</p>
