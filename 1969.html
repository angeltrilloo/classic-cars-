      <h3>mustang boss 1969</h3>
      <P>The Boss 429, sometimes referred to as the "Boss 9" by blue oval enthusiasts, is arguably one of the rarest and most valued muscle cars from the era. The origin of the Boss 429 came about as a result of Fordâ€™s desire to compete in the top NASCAR series. Ford was seeking to develop a "Hemi" engine that could compete with the famed 426 Hemi winged warriors from the Mopar camp - the 426 Hemi Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbirds. At the time, NASCAR required that at least 500 cars be fitted with the competition motor and sold to the general public. The Boss 429 engine featured aluminum cylinder heads, which had a modified Hemi type combustion chamber which Ford called "crescent". The Boss 429 engine used a single Holley four barrel carburetor rated at 735 CFM mounted on an aluminum intake manifold. All these cars had 4-Speed Manual Transmissions and the Boss was rated very conservatively at 375 HP while actual output was believed to be well over 500 horsepower.<P/>
